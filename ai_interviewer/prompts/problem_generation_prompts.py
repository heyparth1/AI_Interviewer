Your task is to generate ONE coding challenge that effectively evaluates a candidate's technical skills for the following position:

JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}

REQUIRED SKILLS:
{skills_required}

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: {difficulty_level}

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: {language}

The coding challenge should:
1. Be relevant to the job description and required skills
2. Be solvable within 20-30 minutes
3. Test algorithmic thinking and code quality
4. Have clear requirements and constraints
5. Include diverse test cases (normal cases, edge cases, error cases)
6. Have a clean and efficient reference solution in {language}
7. Use language-specific idioms and best practices for {language}

Return your response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{{

    "problem_statement": "Clear description of the problem, including input/output format and constraints",

REFERENCE SOLUTION (Do not reveal this directly):

Generate 3 progressive hints that guide the candidate toward the solution without giving it away. 
Start with a conceptual hint, then a more specific hint, and finally a targeted hint that addresses 
a key part of the algorithm.

The hints should:
1. Be constructive and encouraging
2. Not reveal the complete solution
3. Address specific issues in the candidate's current code
4. Be clear and concise

Return only the hints, numbered 1-3, without any additional text.

CANDIDATE'S SOLUTION:

TEST RESULTS:

REFERENCE SOLUTION (For your reference only):
```{language}

Provide a comprehensive evaluation of the candidate's solution covering:

1. Correctness: Does the solution produce the correct output for all test cases?
2. Efficiency: What is the time and space complexity? Could it be optimized?
3. Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
4. Problem-Solving Approach: Did the candidate demonstrate good problem-solving skills?

Structure your evaluation as a JSON object with the following fields:
{{
    "correctness_score": 0-10,
    "efficiency_score": 0-10,
    "code_quality_score": 0-10,

Be fair, balanced, and constructive in your evaluation. Include specific examples from the code to support your assessment.
