# AI Interviewer Platform - Progress Report

## Current Status Summary
The AI Interviewer platform has a functional core interview system with completed sprints for foundation setup, dynamic Q&A, interactive coding challenges, evaluation & reporting, architecture refactoring, and enhanced features. We've implemented a FastAPI backend with MongoDB persistence and a React web frontend, along with voice interaction capabilities using Deepgram's API.

The most recent implementation adds enhanced memory management and context preservation capabilities using LangGraph's advanced persistence features, enabling more natural and coherent interviews even with complex, lengthy conversations.

## Technical Debt & Improvements
1. ⚠️ Add more specific exception handling rather than generic `except Exception`
2. ⚠️ Implement retry mechanisms with backoff for external API calls
3. ⚠️ Add unit tests for the code execution and feedback systems
4. ⚠️ Optimize real-time streaming performance with LiveKit
5. ✅ Enhance LangGraph memory mechanisms for better conversational context
6. ⚠️ Ensure system name and voice characteristics are consistently configurable
