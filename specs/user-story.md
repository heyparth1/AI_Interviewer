# User Story Document for AI Recruiter Platform

## 1. Overview

Our platform redefines technical recruiting with an AI-first approach. It conducts dynamic, voice-driven interviews featuring real-time, adaptive question flows; it integrates interactive coding challenges with AI pair programming assistance (“vibe coding”); and it automatically aggregates detailed, rubric-based evaluations from both conversational and coding sessions. Built on a scalable, cloud-native architecture that leverages state-of-the-art LLMs, containerized code execution, and seamless integrations (e.g., with ATS/HRIS systems), our solution provides employers with a fair, data-driven, and rapid candidate screening process while offering an engaging candidate experience.
