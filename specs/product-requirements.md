## 5. Key Features

### 5.1 AI-Driven Interview Process
- **Dynamic Question Generation:**  
  The platform employs advanced large language models (LLMs) to generate adaptive questions based on candidate responses and job-specific requirements. The AI adjusts the difficulty and follow-up inquiries in real time.
  
- **Real-Time Conversational Interaction:**  
  Using voice-based interviews facilitated by WebRTC, the system supports bi-directional audio with real-time transcription. An AI interviewer uses a fine-tuned LLM to maintain a natural, adaptive conversation, ensuring a personalized experience.
  
- **Interactive Coding Challenges (“Vibe Coding”):**  
  In a dedicated coding environment, candidates complete practical programming tasks that reflect real-world scenarios. The platform integrates an AI pair programming assistant that offers context-aware hints and auto-complete suggestions, emphasizing problem-solving over rote memorization.
  
- **Automated Problem Generation ("Magic Import"):**  
  Recruiters can input job descriptions or skill requirements, and the system auto-generates custom interview challenges, including problem statements, test cases, and reference solutions.
  
- **Rubric-Based Scoring & Transparent Reporting:**  
  Every interview is scored on multiple dimensions—including code correctness, efficiency, quality, and communication—with detailed, AI-generated rationale. A comprehensive report aggregates these scores and explains the trust score, ensuring transparency and consistency.

### 5.2 Cloud Deployment & Scalability
- **Microservices Architecture:**  
  The solution is structured as a suite of containerized services, each dedicated to functions such as session management, AI inference, transcription, code execution, and reporting.
  
- **Autoscaling Infrastructure:**  
  Leveraging Kubernetes (or an equivalent orchestration framework), the system automatically scales compute resources for AI inference, transcription services, and code execution sandboxes based on real-time demand.
  
- **Global Deployment & Low Latency:**  
  The platform is deployed in multiple regions via major cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) to minimize latency and comply with regional data residency requirements. CDN caching is used for static assets and rapid content delivery.

### 5.3 Data Management & Pipelines
- **Secure Media Storage:**  
  Raw audio and video recordings, as well as coding snapshots, are stored in encrypted cloud blob storage.
  
- **Structured Data Management:**  
  Candidate profiles, session metadata, evaluation scores, and detailed logs are stored in a relational database (with complementary NoSQL support for flexible data schemas) to enable fast querying and analytics.
  
- **Processing Pipelines:**  
  Asynchronous job queues handle tasks such as transcription, natural language processing (NLP) analysis, code execution, and evaluation scoring. Messaging systems (e.g., AWS SQS) ensure decoupled workflows and robust error handling.
  
- **Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement:**  
  Anonymized session data is aggregated in a data lake, supporting model retraining, performance monitoring, and regular bias audits.

### 5.4 Integration & Ecosystem
- **API-First Approach:**  
  The solution exposes a comprehensive suite of RESTful APIs (or GraphQL endpoints) for managing interview sessions, retrieving detailed reports, and integrating third-party services.
  
- **ATS/HRIS Connectors:**  
  Pre-built connectors and webhook interfaces ensure seamless integration with leading ATS and HRIS platforms, facilitating automated candidate data updates.
  
- **Third-Party AI and Speech Services:**  
  Where appropriate, the platform integrates with external services for speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and video analysis to enhance feature richness while ensuring cost-effective scaling.
  
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):**  
  Support for SAML and OAuth-based SSO streamlines user authentication within existing enterprise ecosystems.

### 5.5 Security, Privacy & Compliance
- **Robust Data Security:**  
  Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. Access controls, strict authentication measures, and audit logging are enforced across all services.
  
- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
  The platform adheres to key standards such as GDPR, CCPA, and SOC2, and incorporates features like configurable data retention policies and candidate data deletion upon request.
  
- **Bias Mitigation & Transparency:**  
  Explainable AI scoring mechanisms and regular bias audits ensure the evaluation process is fair and transparent. The platform is designed to prevent biased decision-making, providing clear, traceable metrics.
